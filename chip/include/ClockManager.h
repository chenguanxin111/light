/**
 * @brief Retrieves the frequency of a specified clock source.
 *
 * This function returns the current frequency (in Hz) of a specified clock source in the system.
 * The clock source is determined by the 'src' parameter, which should be one of the values
 * defined in the 'clock_src_name_t' enumeration.
 *
 * @param src The clock source for which the frequency is requested. This parameter should be
 *            a value from the 'clock_src_name_t' enumeration, indicating the specific clock source.
 *
 * @return uint32_t The frequency of the specified clock source in Hertz. If the specified source
 *                  is invalid or the frequency cannot be determined, the function may return 0
 *                  or an error code (if defined).
 *
 * @note The accuracy and availability of the returned frequency may depend on the system's
 *       current state and the specific clock source queried.
 *
 * @warning Ensure that the clock source specified in 'src' is initialized and active before
 *          calling this function. Querying an inactive or uninitialized clock source might
 *          lead to undefined behavior or incorrect frequency values.
